A plugin to display the latest tickets in a sidebar widget. Designed to work with WordPress Advanced Ticket System.

== Description ==

This plugin is to be used with the [WordPress Advanced Ticket System](http://www.ticket-system.net/ "WATS"). It is a sidebar widget that displays the latest tickets in the sidebar. It is very similar to the Recent Posts widget already built into WordPress, but only shows links to posts (tickets) with the post_type 'ticket'.

You can set the number of tickets displayed, as well as customise the widget title.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wats-latest-tickets` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add the widget to your sidebar using the 'Widgets' menu in WordPress. Optionally, customise the title of the widget & number of links shown.
